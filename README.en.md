## Project Introduction:

   Nas live broadcast system is a streaming media live broadcast system that allows users to watch live broadcasts through mobile phones, bring goods, give rewards, share short videos and life trends, and share and spread every wonderful moment of live broadcasts.

 The system is independently developed by the Nass network technical team, which can carry out secondary development of the system, and can be deployed in any region of the world. Nas live broadcast system includes PC terminal, H5 terminal, as well as Android and IOS mobile terminals, achieving full coverage.

Supports instant messaging functions such as live video and chat barrage (based on Tencent Cloud IM), and also supports interactive functions such as following, rewarding gifts, and online recharge.

Deep custom Dplayer player, supports multiple video formats.

The PC side and the H5 side have been adapted to ensure that the styles of each terminal are beautiful and consistent.
